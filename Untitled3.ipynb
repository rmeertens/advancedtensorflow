    "\n",
    "Now we were able to solve the cartpole environment it's time to explore other interesting environments. A list with environments available in the OpenAI gym [can be found on this website](https://gym.openai.com/envs/). If you like videogames like me you are probably interested in the Atari environment....\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you dive into these environments it's important to note that these problems are SUPER difficult. It's hard to define exactly what an agent has to do using traditional computer-vision and manually implemented rules. Imagine how hard it is for a neural network to learn what's good and what's bad while only having access to a system in which it gets rewards every time it does something right. In many environments the reward for an action is VERY delayed. In the game breakout you have to start moving in the right direction while the ball is still going up, otherwise you will miss it when it comes down. As you only get a reward when the ball hits a block you get your reward for moving correctly A LOT of frames later than you performed the action...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how difficult this environment is I will walk you through te code that is able to solve it. I will go over some interesting things in the code and explain why they are there. Progress is logged to TensorBoard so you can keep up with what your network is learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that training this neural network can take a VERY long time. In my case I left my computer on for a whole day!\n",

    "This is also the reason I put this video in a separate notebook. You could see this video in which I explain the code as a separate section you should follow if you are interested in diving deeper into deep q-networks. If you are not interested in the explanations, feel free to just run this code all at once and look at the result at the end..."

    "Hopefully you see a working agent now! Feel free to tweak the neural network, hyperparameters, or the environment the agent is playing. I massively enjoy doing this and seeing the result different decisions have on how well the agent plays. As you found out by now training is slow, so try to keep a diary with your changes and the effect this had on the agent. \n",
